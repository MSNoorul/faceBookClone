Let's explain each of the headers mentioned in the code example:

1. **X-XSS-Protection**: This header is a security feature supported by some web browsers. By setting it to `1; mode=block`, it enables the built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection mechanism in the browser. If a potential XSS attack is detected, the browser will block the rendering of the page to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header helps mitigate MIME-sniffing attacks. By setting it to `nosniff`, the browser is instructed to enforce strict adherence to the declared content type and not perform any MIME type sniffing. This reduces the risk of browsers interpreting content in unexpected ways, preventing potential vulnerabilities.

3. **X-Frame-Options**: This header prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling how a web page can be embedded within an iframe. By setting it to `SAMEORIGIN`, the browser restricts the page to be loaded in an iframe only if the origin matches the current domain. This helps protect against malicious attempts to frame a website and deceive users.

4. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: This header enforces secure connections (HTTPS) for a specified duration. By setting it to `max-age=31536000` (one year) and including the `includeSubDomains` directive, the browser is instructed to always access the website over a secure connection. It helps prevent downgrade attacks by ensuring that subsequent requests from the browser are automatically directed to the HTTPS version of the site.

5. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: This header specifies the content security policy for the web page. In the given example, `default-src 'self'` sets the default policy that resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) should be loaded only from the same origin. It prevents loading content from external sources, reducing the risk of code injection attacks like XSS.

These headers collectively enhance the security of web applications by providing protection against common security threats like XSS attacks, MIME-sniffing attacks, clickjacking, and promoting secure communication over HTTPS. By setting these headers in the server's response, you help ensure a safer browsing experience for your users and reduce the risk of various web vulnerabilities.
